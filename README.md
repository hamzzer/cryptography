# cryptography

this is a simple code for encryption and decryption using rot13 algorithm 
who is work ? 
Rot 13 encryption algorithem 
is letter substitution cipher algorithem 
for each letter in the alphabet has a numeric position (1- 26 )
for exemple A has position 1 and Z has position 26 


replaces each word with the 13 th letter after is 
 After p greater than 26 letters reset tp p-26


 for Decrytion 
you can subtract 13 from the an alphabet postion 
if the value is negative then subtract absolute value of it from 26 
and this is done this is the right value of the text
